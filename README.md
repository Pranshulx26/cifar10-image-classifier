🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classifier Web App (PyTorch + Flask)An end-to-end deep learning project where we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify real-world images into 10 categories. The final model achieves 86% test accuracy, and we deployed it as a Flask web application with support for custom image uploads and predictions.📸 Web App Demo (Screenshots)Upload your own image and get a prediction instantly!Upload PagePrediction ResultNote: Replace the image links above with your actual screenshot paths or URLs.📌 Table of Contents📊 Overview🧠 Project Goals📁 Dataset🛠️ Tools & Technologies🧪 Experiments & Model Evolution🚀 Final Model Architecture🖼 Web App Demo💡 Key Learnings📦 Installation🧩 Future Improvements🙌 Acknowledgements📊 OverviewThis project aims to solve the image classification problem using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We started with simple models and iteratively built better-performing CNN architectures through experiments, learning rate tuning, regularization, and augmentation. Our final model, CIFAR10ModelV4, achieved ~86% accuracy and was deployed using Flask for interactive prediction.🧠 Project GoalsBuild a deep learning model to classify CIFAR-10 images.Learn about architecture design, loss functions, and optimizers.Improve performance through tuning and data augmentation.Deploy the trained model on a Flask web app for real-world use.📁 DatasetDataset: CIFAR-10 Source: torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10Classes:airplaneautomobilebirdcatdeerdogfroghorseshiptruckEach image is RGB with a shape of (3, 32, 32).🛠️ Tools & TechnologiesPurposeTools/FrameworksProgrammingPythonDeep LearningPyTorch, TorchvisionWeb FrameworkFlaskWeb UIHTML, CSS, JavaScriptVisualizationMatplotlib, mlxtend, TorchmetricsHostingGitHub Pages (for repo), Flask (local app)EnvironmentConda🧪 Experiments & Model Evolution1. 🧱 Baseline Fully Connected Model (CIFAR10ModelV0)Flattened input, two Linear layersNo activationResult: ~37% accuracyIssue: Lost spatial information2. 🔁 Added ReLU Activations (CIFAR10ModelV1)Added non-linear layersLearning rate too high (0.1) → performance droppedResult: ~33% accuracy3. 🧠 TinyVGG CNN (CIFAR10ModelV2)Basic CNN with 2 Conv blocksResult: ~56% accuracyImprovement via convolutional feature extraction4. 🔧 Learning Rate TuningChanged lr from 0.1 to 0.01Trained for 20 epochs instead of 5Accuracy improved to ~60%5. 🌀 Data AugmentationAdded RandomHorizontalFlip, ColorJitter, RandomCropHelped reduce overfitting and generalize better6. 🔬 Learning Rate SweepTrained for 3 epochs on multiple LRs (1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3)Chose LR that dropped loss fastest7. 🧠 Advanced Deep CNN (CIFAR10ModelV4)4 Conv blocks with:Batch NormalizationReLU activationsDropout regularizationFinal classifier with:Linear → ReLU → Dropout → LinearResult: ~86% accuracy on test set🚀 Final Model ArchitectureConv2d(3 → 32) → BN → ReLU → Conv2d → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout
