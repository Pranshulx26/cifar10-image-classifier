# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classifier Web App (PyTorch + Flask)

An end-to-end deep learning project where we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify real-world images into 10 categories. The final model achieves **86% test accuracy**, and we deployed it as a **Flask web application** with support for custom image uploads and predictions.

## 📊 Overview

This project aims to solve the image classification problem using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We started with simple models and iteratively built better-performing CNN architectures through experiments, learning rate tuning, regularization, and augmentation. Our final model, `CIFAR10ModelV4`, achieved **~86% accuracy** and was deployed using **Flask** for interactive prediction.

## 🧪 Experiments & Model Evolution

### 1. 🧱 Baseline Fully Connected Model (`CIFAR10ModelV0`)
- Flattened input, two `Linear` layers
- No activation
- Result: **~37% accuracy**
- Issue: Lost spatial information

### 2. 🔁 Added ReLU Activations (`CIFAR10ModelV1`)
- Added non-linear layers
- Learning rate too high (0.1) → performance dropped
- Result: **~33% accuracy**

### 3. 🧠 TinyVGG CNN (`CIFAR10ModelV2`)
- Basic CNN with 2 Conv blocks
- Result: **~56% accuracy**
- Improvement via convolutional feature extraction

### 4. 🔧 Learning Rate Tuning
- Changed `lr` from `0.1` to `0.01`
- Trained for 20 epochs instead of 5
- Accuracy improved to **~60%**

### 5. 🌀 Data Augmentation
- Added `RandomHorizontalFlip`, `ColorJitter`, `RandomCrop`
- Helped reduce overfitting and generalize better

### 6. 🔬 Learning Rate Sweep
- Trained for 3 epochs on multiple LRs (`1e-1`, `1e-2`, `1e-3`)
- Chose LR that dropped loss fastest

### 7. 🧠 Advanced Deep CNN (`CIFAR10ModelV4`)
- 4 Conv blocks with:
  - Batch Normalization
  - ReLU activations
  - Dropout regularization
- Final classifier with:
  - Linear → ReLU → Dropout → Linear
- Result: **~86% accuracy on test set**

## 🚀 Final Model Architecture

```
Conv2d(3 → 32) → BN → ReLU → Conv2d → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout
Conv2d(32 → 64) → BN → ReLU → Conv2d → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout
Conv2d(64 → 128) → BN → ReLU → Conv2d → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout
Conv2d(128 → 256) → BN → ReLU → Conv2d → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout
→ Flatten → Linear(1024 → 512) → ReLU → Dropout → Linear(512 → 10)
```
